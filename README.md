# Franklin Davis-Duhaney 
#### Hi, My name is Franklin Davis-Duhaney, but most call me Frankie. I was born in Panama City, Panama. I moved to the United States when I was eight years old, and I’m grateful and beyond blessed with an opportunity to be able to accomplish so many great things in this country. I love sports and I love statistics because numbers never lies. I’m an ex-student athlete. I played for the University of Central Florida and Southeast Missouri State University, where I studied criminal justice/ criminology. I have over 10 years experience in commercial and residential construction, and now I’m looking forward to furthering my education in Data Analytics, SQL and Python. Here are some goals I want to set for myself for this cohort bootcamp.

    - Learn to work in a agile setting through the whole course
    - Learning and understanding SQL, VS Code and Python.
    - Communication with my team and instructors.
    - Doing what's best for my agile team and not what's best for me.
    - Work on resume and land the perfect job.

  <a href= "https://thedailyrecord.com/2023/03/27/lockheed-martin-dsta-to-collaborate-on-data-analytics-and-workflow-automation/"> In this article it talks about the collaboration agreement with Lockheed Martin and Singapore Agency exploring data analytics and workflow..</a>




Python ,SQL,VS Coding is a completely new language for me and it can be difficult at time but I love a challenge, I love results. I'm super excited to learn and grasp Data Analytics, SQL and Python.  


I chose this picture because Lockheed Martin was my first field trip I took during my freshman year of high school with my best friend in Orlando, Florida. When we talk about our childhood, we think of great memories and Lockheed Martin was one of many. He has a great career with Lockheed as a sales consultant.
